I'm a web develooper and artist.
Expert with opensource databases, like MySQL. Creating web pages and applications since the html 4 standard, working with content management frameworks, like wordpress or drupal.
I like to learn new technoligies, but i try to avoid some.
I read a lot, mostly sci-fi and about programing. Uncle Bob and Asimov are my favorites.
I had to work with accounting and reports. I don't like it very much, but sometimes i can use communication or design skills in this field too, that can be fun.
